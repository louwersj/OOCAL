Status files located in /opt/oopcal/status are used to set or check the status of oopcal.

status_firstboot
file is used to set and check the first boot options of oopcal. If the firstboot options
within oopcal are used the status_firstboot is checked. If the value is 0 the firstboot
scripts will be executed. In case the value is 1 it is assumed that the firstboot has
already been executed and nothing is done. Setting the status back from 1 to 0 manually
is not promoted and you have to ensure you understand the actions that will be executed
during the next boot of your machine.
